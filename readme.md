## Todo:
 - clicking on UI elements to set active
 - text cursor in text box
 - dragable UI elements
 - resizable
 - finish "character name" modal and add to module
 - ui element builder with ability to export

## Ideas:
Application will start out as a management system for a West Marches campaign but turn into a player driven West Marches game, using a custom ruleset.

 - follow system with formations
 - auto roll for hiddens (perception) with ability to halt party movement on success
 - ability to vote on character action to manage afk/absent player
   - option for basic AI
 - dungeon editor to create dungeons
   - voting modal at the end of dungeons for feedback
   - basic unit scripting available
 - camera controls for "cinematics"
   - example, a tile has an "onReveal" or "onStep" event that starts a cinematic sequence where player movement is stopped and the camera follows a series of torches being lit
 - system should allow for a dungeon creator to test run a dungeon with certain levels and classes
 - leader is a "class" that gives the player the ability to rearrange turn order, increase success/buff, demoralize/debuff opponents, etc
 - perhaps there is a small race like pixies, brownies, or gnomes and the player controls multiple characters
 - ghost race could have many benefits but is unable to pickup or equip anything
   - perhaps this is a minion type for a necro
 - trade skills are an afk minigame players can spend their money on
   - ultima style leveling on gathering could suppliment trade skills
